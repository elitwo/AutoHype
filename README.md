# AutoHype

Catch the pump early, by watching Elon Musk's Twitter for trigger phrases relating to Dogecoin. 

@elonmusk *doge* -> script automatically uses the binance API to place a long futures trade on $DOGE

WARNING: Dogecoin is a shitcoin, and this is still gambling, even though it's likely to net you some profits.

# Config

You need to config everything. You need:

1. Twitter bot application & API keys (you may need to get approved for this. Not sure)
2. Binance API keys, with futures enabled
3. A personal risk tolerance in the form of how much DOGE you buyin

Add these keys and settings to config.py.

Run it! You might want to test with your own twitter to ensure it's working. Just add your twitter ID to the list.
